```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(janitor)
library(here)

```

See where the script thinks it is

```{r}

here::here()

```

Don't use setwd as this could be a privacy issue, could break constantly, will throw a tantrum on Windows VS Macs...
Use "here" instead.

Show the first rows of our table

```{r}

head(penguins_raw)

```

```{r}

colnames(penguins_raw)

```

This SHOULD replace / and spaces with dots...
but my PC is clever.
But we don't want "studyName" to not be capitalised.
If we want to change column names, NEVER change the excel spreadsheet, as this is non-reproducible.

Save the penguins data as a csv file, within the "data" file, in "here" (the current directory).

```{r}

write.csv(penguins_raw, here("data","penguins_raw.csv"))

```

Clean up and get rid of some columns

```{r}

#colnames(penguins_raw)

#penguins_raw <- select(penguins_raw, -Comments)

#colnames(penguins_raw)

```

This is bad practice as the PC has a hissyfit that "comments" doesn't exist anymore if we run it again.
We've wrecked this file now, we need to reset it.

Reset the data using our safe copy that we saved just before this disaster:

```{r}

#penguins_raw <- read.csv(here("data","penguins_raw.csv"))

#colnames(penguins_raw)
# show_col_types = FALSE stops it printing after loading

```

A better way to get rid of comments!

```{r}

#penguins_clean <- select(penguins_raw, -Comments)
#penguins_clean <- select(penguins_clean, -starts_with("Delta"))

#colnames(penguins_clean)

```

This is also bad code, as we're overriding penguins_clean.

Use piping from tidyverse to remove our hated columns.

```{r}

#penguins_clean <- penguins_raw %>%
#  select(-Comments) %>%
#  select(-starts_with("Delta"))

#colnames(penguins_clean)

```

We can now do an extra step using "janitor", This'll clean up the column titles and remove the weird capitals and dots and stuff.

```{r}

#penguins_clean <- penguins_raw %>%
#  select(-Comments) %>%
#  select(-starts_with("Delta")) %>%
#  clean_names()

#colnames(penguins_clean)

```

Bear in mind the order - doing "clean_names" first will make this break, as it can't get rid of Comments (with a capital C)

Save penguins_clean as a new csv file

```{r}
write.csv(penguins_clean, here("data","penguins_clean.csv"))

```

We can make our own functions!
We COULD copy and paste code, but this is a pain.
("Where is it!?")

```{r}

cleaning_penguin_columns <- function(raw_data){
  raw_data <- penguins_raw %>%
   select(-Comments) %>%
   select(-starts_with("Delta")) %>%
   clean_names()
}

penguins_clean <- cleaning_penguin_columns(penguins_raw)

colnames(penguins_clean)

penguins_clean

```

But, we want to move our function into its own file.
See Cleaning.R

Now we want to load our functions!

```{r}

source(here("functions","Cleaning.R"))

shorten_species(penguins_clean)


cleaning_penguin_columns <- function(raw_data){
  print("Cleaned names, removed comments, removed empty rows, removed delta")
  raw_data %>%
    clean_names() %>%
    shorten_species() %>%
    remove_empty(c("rows", "cols")) %>%
    select(-Comments) %>%
    select(-starts_with("Delta"))
}




```

You now have a renv file.

```{r}

install.packages("renv")
renv::init() #Don't run if you already have the renv file

#This will load and store the packages in the renv file. Now:
install.packages("table1")

#This will take and store the all running packages in the renv file.
renv::snapshot()
#This'll make a renv.lock file that can be shared, a total lock on all our packages.

```

You can also run renv::diagnostics() to view the packages you have in your renv file.
Renv will keep track of your packages. Doing "snapshot" above will save all packages to a renv.lock file which you can share.


Load ggplot2:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```


We want to make a box plot as an exploratory figure:
This shows the reader the raw data - this'll show the shape of the data.
Scatter plot is a figure for 2 continuous variables.
Scatter plot with a line through it IS NOT exploratory - you're already analysing it.

Using "here()" is good, as it works for all PCs.

```{r}
penguins_clean <- read_csv(here("data", "penguins_clean.csv"))
```


Make a flipper box plot

```{r}
#This tells you what data to use
flipper_boxplot <- ggplot(
  data = penguins_clean,
  aes(x = species,
      y = flipper_length_mm)
) +
  geom_boxplot()

#This will show you the plot.
flipper_boxplot

#There'll be a warning - that it has removed NA values.


```


We want to fix the error from above.
We want to remove all the NAs from the flipper_length column.

```{r}

#This will only take these 2 columns and put them in a new variable.
penguins_flippers <- select(penguins_clean, c("species","flipper_length_mm")) %>%
  drop_na()

colnames(penguins_flippers)

#Now remove NAs... BUT WAIT! we're overwriting!
#penguins_flippers <- 
#Instead use piping to make this reproducible.

species_colours <- c("Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)" = "darkorange",
                     "Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)" = "purple",
                     "Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)" = "cyan4")

#Now we can make the plot again
  flipper_boxplot <- ggplot(
  data = penguins_flippers,
  aes(x = species,
      y = flipper_length_mm)
) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = species),
               width = 0.3,
               show.legend=FALSE) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = species),
              alpha = 0.3,
              show.legend = FALSE,
              position = position_jitter(
                width = 0.2,
                seed = 0)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = species_colours) +
  labs(x = "species",
       y = "Flipper Length (mm)") +
    theme_bw()
              

  
#This will show you the plot.
flipper_boxplot
 
#This graph is a pretty ugly graphic. So we can add COLOUR! by modding the code.
#We also want to remove the auto-generated legend
#And we want to show all the datapoints with jitter, to space them out on the x axis.
#But still, this isn't reproducible - jitter does it differently each time.
#We can make it not "random" by specifing a seed. We can also colour the points, and make the spread along x smaller.
#We can change the width of the boxes.
#We can also make the datapoints more transparent to make the boxes more visible. This is "alpha".
#We can also add in labels.


#These colours are not very good. They are not colourblind-friendly. Never use red and green together. See code for "penguin_colours".


#We may want to convert this code to make a plot into a function.
#To do this, you'd make another R script and put the code in there. See supplementary information.

#So we have a lovely figure now. How do we re-size things for our poster and shit?
#Make a subfolder called figures, and install the "ragg" and "svglite" packages.
#You'd need to update the renv, or you can install them through renv to skip this.





```



```{r}

Just need to install git.
"git push" will let you move it onto the hub.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document.
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
